# Devops Practice

This is a monorepo that will be used to demonstrate a number of small projects utilising different CI/CD practices, 
infrastructure provisioning and automation to setup applications. Each project will contain a README of the steps 
involved in setting up the application, infrastructure provisioning, deployment etc that can ideally be replicated
easily enough.
