# TestApp

## Purpose
This is developed to test setting up and implementing a basic CRUD application using Webflux.
Aside from just implementing the basic CRUD functionality, it is will have the following:
- Using a Gradle Wrapper to build the application
- MLabs for storing all the data
- Travis.CI for running builds and tests on commits
- Saving build artefacts in AWS S3 
- Triggering a deploy to an EC2 instance with the most recent build artefact __(TODO)__
- Infrastructure provisioning will be done using Terraform __(TODO)__

Testing won't be comprehensive but this can be used as a template application for , __steps for the CI/CD will also be documented__.
