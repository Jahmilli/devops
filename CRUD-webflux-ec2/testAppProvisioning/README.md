# Test App Provisioning
This is used to provision the infrastructure required to host the SpringBoot test application i'm currently working on, [check it out here](https://github.com/Jahmilli/testApp).
Ideally, this would be deployed as a docker container into an ECS Cluster, or another container orchestrator, but for the 
sake of learning how to do all these steps I am starting off simple and this can hopefully act as some sort of documentation
for what's involved to build the infrastructure to host a Springboot app.
